# Write a function to generate the nth term of Gijswijt's sequence.

[Gijswijt's sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gijswijt%27s_sequence) is a self-describing sequence where each number describes the contiguous repetition of the previous block in the sequence.

The first few terms are: `1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2 ...`

Return the nth term of Gijswijt's sequence.

Example

For this input: `n = 7`
the result should be: `2`

Reason: The first seven terms of Gijswijt's sequence are: `1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2`. The seventh term is 2.

## Instructions

Given a string str, return a new string where all the letters are reversed but the numbers remain at their original positions.

For example, given "w7xy3z", the letters are "wxyz" and numbers are "73".

Reversing the letters gives us "zyxw", where we can put "73" at its original position to result in "z7yx3w".

Example
For this input

str = "H2SO4"
the result should be:

"O2SH4"
Reason: "HSO" is reversed but "24" remains at its original position.

Example
For this input

str = "a1b2c3d4"
the result should be:

"d1c2b3a4"
Reason: "abcd" is reversed but "1234" remains at its original position.

# 7-1 Bug In the Apple

You're given a 2D array called apple, which contains rows of strings. Each string represents either an "A" (Apple) or a "B" (Bug in the Apple).

There is exactly one "B" somewhere in the array â€” no more, no less.
Your task is to find the location of this "B".

Input:

```js
const apple = [
  ['A', 'A', 'A'],
  ['A', 'B', 'A'],
  ['A', 'A', 'A'],
]
```

output -> `[1, 1]`

# 7-2.

Given a length, an offset, and a list, slide a window of that length, moving by that offset every step, over the list, returning a list of lists.

```js
for 2, 1, [0,1,2,3,4] return [ [0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4] ]
for 2, 2, [0,1,2,3,4] return [ [0,1], [2,3] ]
for 2, 3, [0,1,2,3,4] return [ [0,1], [3,4] ]
```

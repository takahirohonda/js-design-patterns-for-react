# Two crystal ball problem

Given two crystal balls that will break if dropped from high enough distance,
determine the exact spot in which it will break in the most optimised way.

[0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90]

**Solutions**

Walk square root of n and O becomes O(square root of n). This enables us not to do linear search which makes O(n).

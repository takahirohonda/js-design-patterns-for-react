# Dijkstra's Shortest Path

It belongs to a family called greedy algorithm.

Calculating the shortest path from one node to all the other nodes of the graph.

Dijkstra -> j is silence. Pronounced as dai-k-stra

`Time Complexity`: `O(V^2)` in the worst case (since we're sorting the priority queue each time).

`Space Complexity`: `O(V)` for the distances, visited, and priority queue arrays.

Use BFS.

# Making Canva App

You’re an engineer tasked with an open-ended challenge: build a simplified version of the Canva Editor.
Obviously, the real Canva Editor has been built by many engineers over many years—we can’t replicate all of its features in an hour. So, your first task is to choose a very small set of features and interactions, and build basic MVP versions of them.
This task comes with no starter kit or boilerplate. You’re free to use any language or framework, but please avoid spending too much time setting up tools or your environment.
You decide what features, UI, and interactions to include. Keep in mind that you only have an hour, and by the end of the interview, your code must be production-ready—based on your own definition of what that means. Please clearly state your production readiness criteria.

Let’s begin by writing a short plan that outlines:

The list of features, UI elements, and interactions you aim to implement
Your definition of production readiness
This can be done in a text file, notes app, or wherever you're comfortable. Once that’s done, we’ll start building. Please don’t overcommit.
You’re encouraged to use AI throughout the task—for coding, problem-solving, research, debugging, or anything else—but we want to see your own thinking and decision-making. Speak your thoughts out loud as much as possible. Make sure you're not outsourcing the design or decision-making entirely to AI.
If you don’t have any questions, let’s get started.

# WHat I can ship:

## UI

- side bar with assets
- main canvas to create
- top bar for tools (colour picker, text, graphic design tools)

## Functionality

1. Drag image from side bar to the canvas
2. Update background colour from the colour picker
3. Text insertion (nice to have).

## Unit test coverage - 90%

1. functionality implemented
2. unit test coverage of 90%
